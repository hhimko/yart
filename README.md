# Ray Tracer

## 1. Key Concepts
  - Interactive, Real-time* Path Tracing
  - CPU based rendering with multithreading (Thread-pool based)
  - Static scenes defined by triangle meshes
  - Physically Based Rendering
  
 
</br>

## 2. Project Modules

### Scene 
  - Basic OBJ file parsing for vertex-normal-uv data
  - Pre-computed Bounding Volume Hierarchy as Acceleration Structure (AABB-based, Surface Area Heuristic model)
  - Per-object materials
  - Material index table
  - Solid color/HDRI Skyboxes
  - Ambient illumination from the skybox
  - Point and Area lights
  
### Material
  - Solid/Texture sampled diffuse color 
  - PBR: Roughness, Specular, Metalic...
  - Soft edges using normal interpolation
  - BRDF/Direct lighting illumination
  
### Renderer (Raytracer)
  - Monte Carlo Integration with Importance Sampling 
  - [Next Event Estimation] light sampling
  - Distribution Ray Tracing for antialiasing, soft shadows, DoF, etc.
  - Triangle-Ray intersection with MÃ¶ller-Trumbore
  - Hit/Miss "shader" pipeline
  - Denoising and Antialiasing using jitter accumulation
  - Rendering to GPU texture
