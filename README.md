# Yet Another Ray Tracer

YART *(Yet Another Ray Tracer)* is a real-time ray tracing engine on CPU. 
Created for a bachelors degree applied CS thesis titled "Implementation of a ray tracing engine using a CPU based renderer". 


## Dependencies
YART comes with most dependencies vendored-in as git submodules for convenience. 
These include [GLFW], [GLM] and [Dear ImGui]. 
The only exception is the [Vulkan SDK], which has to be downloaded manually for your target OS.


### Getting the Vulkan SDK
The latest version of the Vulkan development kit can be downloaded from the [official download page](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows). 

YART by default will look for the SDK in `C:/VulkanSDK` and will link against the most recent version installed there.
If you wish to specify a custom search path or a specific SDK version, you can use the `VULKAN_SDK` and `VULKAN_VERSION` flags when compiling with cmake:

```shell
> cmake -S . -B build -DVULKAN_SDK=C:/Path/To/SDK -DVULKAN_VERSION=x.y.z.w
```

## Building From Source
YART uses [CMake] (version 3.13+) as its build system. 

  1. Clone the repo. Make sure to clone with flag `--recurse-submodules` to initialize submodules, or run ` git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning:
  ```shell
  > git clone https://github.com/hhimko/yart.git --recurse-submodules
  > cd yart
  ``` 

  2. Install all required [dependencies],

  3. Build YART with CMake:
  ```shell
  > mkdir build
  > cmake -S . -B ./build 
  > cmake --build ./build --config Release --target yart
  ```
